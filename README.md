# Paper submision checklist

Let's share a useful checklist to go through before submitting a paper or an article for review. [Assuming that Latex is used]

## Checklist
1. **Duplicate variable names/symbols**. Make sure that different math variables or symbols have unique identifiers.
  - E.g. is the same `$R$` representing both the rotation matrix and the set of real numbers?
2. **Punctuation consistency**. Respect the same punctuaction style throughout the paper.
  - E.g. if you end a list `\item` with a `;`, do not forget to do the same in the rest of the paper.
3. **Double check refernces**. At the end of the writing phase, it may happen that some references `\ref` or `\label` are messed up due to some refactoring of the sections or due to a rough copy-past. Read one again paying attention that the references are effectively pointing to the desired chapter/section/figure/table/etc.
4. **Figure captions**. Despite figures may capture most of reviewers' attentions, often authors are in a rush and rather focus on the body of the article. Remember to review the figure captions and to make sure that they are sound and clear.
5. **Capital letters**. When you refer to a figure/section/chapetr, do you use capital letters? If you choose one of the two, make sure you keep the same style throught the article.
 - E.g. `as shown in Figure...` or `as shown in figure...`?
6. **Respect the margins**. Do figures fit in the margins?
